# Simple-Calculator
Here is my first project in C programming , it is a simple calculator .



## Main Function in My Claculator.

1. Addition Operation.
2. Subtraction Operation.
3. Multiplication Operation.
4. Division Operation.




## How does the calculator work?

- all operation work based on two operands.
- each operand stored in double type variable  For greater accuracy during operations.
- after the user performs his operation : the program asks  him if he needs to perform any operation berfore closing the program.



## Troubleshooting Department.

1. When the user selects the operation he needs, it is checked whether his choice is consistent with the available options so that the program does not collapse.
2. When the user performs the division operation, we ensure that the divisor does not equal zero so that the program does not crash. If we verify the presence of this error, we notify the user via a warning message and ask him to re-enter the values ​​again.
